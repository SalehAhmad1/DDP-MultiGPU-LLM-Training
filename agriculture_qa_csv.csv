Question,Answer
What is the ideal pH range for most crops?,"Most crops grow best in soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral."
What are the three primary nutrients that plants need for healthy growth?,"The three primary nutrients are nitrogen (N) for leaf growth, phosphorus (P) for root development, and potassium (K) for overall plant health."
What is crop rotation and why is it beneficial?,"Crop rotation is the practice of growing different types of crops in the same area across seasons. It helps prevent soil depletion, reduces pest buildup, and can improve soil fertility."
What is the difference between organic and inorganic fertilizers?,"Organic fertilizers come from natural sources like compost or manure and release nutrients slowly, while inorganic fertilizers are synthetic and provide immediate nutrient availability."
What are the main factors that affect plant germination?,"The main factors affecting germination are adequate moisture, proper temperature, sufficient oxygen, and viable seeds. Some seeds also require specific light conditions."
